for this project we converted create savings account, list all savings account, print monthly statement and get customer info functionality
into services. For building the restful api we used springboot service and postman to test out the functionality.
we created two controller trycontroller.java and usercontroller,java to perform the functionality. We created an object of every class from 
previous version so we did not have to change the code in previous version. With the help of springboot we were able to convert the 
functionality easily into the services. We performed get, post, put and delete mapping to acheive the desired result. Get mapping is used
to fetch the stored data, post mapping is used to post the new data in the database, put mapping is used to update the existing the record
and delete mapping is used to delete the record. We used all this verb when developing the services. We used postmapping to create savings
account which call all the function from the previous version that are required when creating the saving account. We used get mapping to
get the customer info, print monthly statement, and saving account info from the database which is displayed to the user. We also used put
mapping and delete mapping to update our record.
